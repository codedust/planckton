# Planckton
Planckton stands for **Planck** **t**ime **on**line and aims to be a powerful and easy-to-use time tracking software written in Python/Django.

Pull requests, bug reports and feature requests (via github issues) are always welcome. :)
Feel free to ask for help in the issue tracker, too.

## Is Planckton the right time tracking software for me?
As plankton cannot swim against the current, Planckton is the right time tracking software for you because you probably cannot go back in time. If you can, this statement needs to be revised. Please file a bug in the bug tracker in this case!
